This library crate is a building block of the Kodiak project, thus the naming of the crate.
Although, Kodiak has some quite specific requirements for a taxonomy, `kodiak-taxonomy` is kept generic,
provides value on its own and might be of interest for other projects as well.

So, feel free to use it. If you consider using `kodiak-taxonomy` in your project but are missing functionality,
don't hesitate to file an issue on Github.

We are looking forward to your feedback.

# Impressions

todo: show two examples of taxonomies supported by kodiak-taxonomy

Provide additional examples in EXAMPLES.md and link to it.

# TL;DR

Kodiak's specific requirements regarding its taxonomy:
- An element can have more than one superordinate element
- The top of the taxonomy allows multiple elements, i.e. users are free to create multiple root-nodes
- Elements might be complemented by arbitrary metadata (still todo: not implemented yet)
- Edges (a tuple of a super and its sub element) might be complemented with arbitrary attributes (still todo: not implemented yet)

# Known issues / limitations
- üèóÔ∏è Version 0.1.0 does not yet power other projects, so API has not yet proven it's power in practice.
- üöß Code is fully covered by unit tests, however, some integration tests are still missing and documentation has room for improvement.
- Rust API Guidelines have not yet been considered.
- üêß Version 0.1.x is developed and tested on Linux only.

# Roadmap and future considerations

## Version 0.3.0 (planned)
- Implement Iterator trait.
- Implement Serde's Serialize and Deserialize.

## Version 0.2.0 (in progress)
- Review and follow Rust API Guidelines.
- Improve documentation: e.g. comply to C-LINK from Rust API Guidelines.
- Full code coverage with tests, measured by tarpaulin and added as a badge to Github project 
- Add support for arbitrary metadata / attributes at the Node and Edge level.

## Version 0.1.0 (delivered)
- Initial release.
