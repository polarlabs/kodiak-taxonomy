Get things organized with this powerful, yet easy to use taxonomy.

This library crate is a building block of the Kodiak project, thus the naming of the crate.
Although, Kodiak has some quite specific requirements for a taxonomy, `kodiak-taxonomy` is kept generic,
provides value on its own and might be of interest for other projects as well.

A taxonomy[^Wikipedia] is a classification scheme to organize things
according to their types. Often, taxonomies offer a strictly hierarchical organization providing a
tree-like structure. However, in practice, such taxonomies limit our ability to model our complex reality.

When looking for a powerful taxonomy which overcomes such limitations, `kodiak-taxonomy` might be a good fit
for you. So, feel free to use it. If you consider using `kodiak-taxonomy` in your project but are missing functionality
or have any other concerns, don't hesitate to file an issue on GitHub.

We are looking forward to your feedback.

# Impressions

todo: show two examples of taxonomies supported by kodiak-taxonomy

Provide additional examples in EXAMPLES.md and link to it.

# TL;DR

Kodiak's specific requirements regarding its taxonomy:
- An element can have more than one superordinate element
- The top of the taxonomy allows multiple elements, i.e. users are free to create multiple root-nodes
- Elements might be complemented by arbitrary metadata (still todo: not implemented yet)
- Edges (a tuple of a super and its sub element) might be complemented with arbitrary attributes (still todo: not implemented yet)

# Known issues / limitations
- üèóÔ∏è Version 0.2.0 does not yet power other projects, so API has not yet proven it's power in practice.
- üöß Code is fully covered by unit tests, however, some integration tests are still missing.
- Documentation has still some room for improvement.
- üêß Version 0.2.x is developed and tested on Linux only.

# Roadmap and future considerations

## Version 0.7.0 (planned)
- Add performance consideration of public functions to the documentation.

## Version 0.6.0 (planned)
- Implement Iterator trait.
- Implement Display trait for Node.

## Version 0.5.0 (planned)
- Implement Serde's Serialize and Deserialize.

## Version 0.4.0 (planned)
- Add support for arbitrary metadata / attributes at the Node and Edge level.

## Version 0.3.0 (in progress)
- Re-thing the API: implement `Taxonomy` as a thin wrapper around std::collections::HashMap and get rid of TaxonomyError (see [CHECKLIST_RUST_API_CONFORMANCE](CHECKLIST_RUST_API_CONFORMANCE.md))
- Improve documentation (see [CHECKLIST_RUST_API_CONFORMANCE](CHECKLIST_RUST_API_CONFORMANCE.md))
- Publish Software Bill of Material (SBOM) together with any future release.
- Use LLVM engine of Tarpaulin to check code coverage.

## Version 0.2.0 (delivered)
- Review and follow Rust API Guidelines.
- Improve documentation: e.g. comply to C-LINK from Rust API Guidelines.
- Full code coverage with tests, measured by tarpaulin and added as a badge to GitHub project 
- Switch to `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`

## Version 0.1.0 (delivered)
- Initial release.
