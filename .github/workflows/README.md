Quality is at the core of the Kodiak brand. We leverage Github Actions, a powerful CI/CD engine, to make sure we meet the expectations. 

Implemented quality checks:

* cargo test
* cargo fmt --all -- --check
* cargo clippy --all-features -- -D warnings
* cargo tarpaulin --ignore-tests

Code coverage report is uploaded to Codecov.

Implemented security checks:

* cargo audit (runs if dependencies have changed and scheduled once a day)

Todo: cargo geiger
